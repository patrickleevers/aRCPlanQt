aRCPlan

aRCplan is C++ implementation of engineering model used to analyse rapid crack propagation (RCP) in plastic pipe. RCP is a potentially catastrophic mode of failure characterised by rapid, axial propagation of a crack in a pipeline pressurised by gas, liquid or a gas/liquid mixture.

This program uses the model published by Dr Patrick Leevers in ["An engineering model for rapid crack propagation along fluid pressurised plastic pipe"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013794412003530). External to the central model, the program provides an interface and range of inputs and outputs.
